Vectors Worksheet

Q1(a)
when iam playing cs2 and we are using grenades in game, the game has to calculate all the vectors that will influence the grenade's trajectory. for example if the player is running forward that adds an extra forward vector to the grenade's vector, if the player jumps it will increase the upward vector of the grenade.

Q1(b)
gravity is a constant force that draws an object toward the centre of any celestial bodies. the standard magnitude given for earth's gravity is 9.807m/s. 

Q1(c)
no the gravity vector is constantly changing. assuming that the origin is the centre of the planet, the gravity vector acting upon mario would look like this : the tail of the vector on mario and head of the vector on the centre of the planet. thus when mario runs around the planet the tail of the vector will constantly be changing thus the vector wont be the same for all the positions on the surface of the planet.

Q4(i)
line 27 getting MeshFilter component and setting it to the meshFilter variable
line 28 setting the originalMesh variable to the shared mesh filter which is the actual mesh asset so all changes to the mesh will affect all objects that use that mesh as a reference. 
line 29 setting the clonedMesh variable as a new mesh. 
line 30 setting the mesh in the cloneMesh variable to have the name of clone
line 31-35 setting all the varibles in cloneMesh to be the same as the originalMesh
line 37 setting all the vertices in the clonedMesh into the vertices array
line 38 setting all the triangles in the cloneMesh into the triangles array  

Q4(ii)
if you dont use clonedMesh any changes you make the original mesh will affect unity's default mesh because in line 28 we set the original mesh to equal to the shared mesh of the mesh filter.
