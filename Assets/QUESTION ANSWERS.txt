Vectors Worksheet

Q1(a)
when iam playing cs2 and we are using grenades in game, the game has to calculate all the vectors that will influence the grenade's trajectory. for example if the player is running forward that adds an extra forward vector to the grenade's vector, if the player jumps it will increase the upward vector of the grenade.

Q1(b)
gravity is a constant force that draws an object toward the centre of any celestial bodies. the standard magnitude given for earth's gravity is 9.807m/s. 

Q1(c)
no the gravity vector is constantly changing. assuming that the origin is the centre of the planet, the gravity vector acting upon mario would look like this : the tail of the vector on mario and head of the vector on the centre of the planet. thus when mario runs around the planet the tail of the vector will constantly be changing thus the vector wont be the same for all the positions on the surface of the planet.

Matrices Worksheet

Q4(i)
line 27 getting MeshFilter component and setting it to the meshFilter variable
line 28 setting the originalMesh variable to the shared mesh filter which is the actual mesh asset so all changes to the mesh will affect all objects that use that mesh as a reference. 
line 29 setting the clonedMesh variable as a new mesh. 
line 30 setting the mesh in the cloneMesh variable to have the name of clone
line 31-35 setting all the varibles in cloneMesh to be the same as the originalMesh
line 37 setting all the vertices in the clonedMesh into the vertices array
line 38 setting all the triangles in the cloneMesh into the triangles array  

Q4(ii)
if you dont use clonedMesh any changes you make the original mesh will affect unity's default mesh because in line 28 we set the original mesh to equal to the shared mesh of the mesh filter.

Q6(a)
while doing the matrices worksheet i feel like the most difficult part of it was understanding what i was suppose to code. spceifically for the SetTranslationMatrix and SetRotationMat functions, at first i didnt know what i was doing or what i was suppose to be doing. with the help of my classmates and mr douglas's comments, i found out that the function was suppose to set the translation and rotation matrix for the matrix fed into them. then i looked at the slides to figure out what these matrices are suppose to look like and found them on slide 5 of the matrices part 2 deck of slides. Using that and a bit of the wikipedia page for each of these matrices i managed to do complete the functions. i also had a hard time with the math behind matrices everytime i look at the slides the formulas look very daunting and i just get lost in all the algebra, numbers, and fractions, luckily my friends help me by explaining it to me step by step.

Q6(b)
matrix concatenation. matrix concatenation is when you have a bunch of matrices you want to use to transform an object. instead of multiplying each vertex a bunch of times by all the matrices, you multiply all the matrices in order of first to last, right to left. this will give you one matrix that will perfrom all the transformations in 1 multiplication. where i got confused was why the matrices needed to be in order, if you pitch an airplane 90 degrees down then roll the plane 90 degrees left it would be the same as doing it backwards. But after looking at slide 50 and 54 of the worksheet in the matrix part 2 deck of slides and doing some roatation using my hands, i realised i was confusing local transform and world transform. because in world transform when you rotate an object the axes do not rotate with the object, so the sequence of rotations do matter. is this the reason matrices are not commutative?

Q6(c)
overall this worksheet has been very helpful in understanding matrices, it may just be me but i only really understood matrices when i started doing the worksheets. during class i would listen and be kinda confused about whats going on on the slides, i would kind of understand what mr douglas is saying but it is only when i started doing the worksheets, i truly understood the topic. not just the matrices worksheet i feel the same for the vectors one as well. i especially liked the questions where the code was blanked out and a hint was given, the hints helped me understand what each line of code i am writing in the function is suppose to do, yet i had to have the knowledge to complete the code myself. this was especially effective in helping me understand the code as i am both writing it myself and am knowing what the intended purpose of the code is, so i know if the code is correct or wrong. although i see the vector one relating more to game development i still dont understand how matrices are related (something about computer graphics) to it as it feels like i would never need to transform an object like this unless iam doing low-level coding.

Dynamics & Kinematics worksheet 

Part 1 
Yes it does follow Newton's First Law of motion because the object is moving at a constant speed and not accelerating or decelerating since there are no more forces acting upon it

(a)
The most difficult part of this worksheet i feel is the coding part although most of the code has been handfed to us it took me really long to understand what each line of code is suppose to do and therefore i dont know what iam suppose to write. there isnt really a way to overcome this, i just read the instructions and try to visualise what each line of code before it is doing to understand what i need to do in my code. i think i would have really prefered it if we just had one question but we had to code everything by ourselves, when given the code i often find myself comparing the length of the blanked out part to my own code to see if i got it right. because of this i might've missed out on a few ways to shorten the code. but i dont think this is feasible as there is more then 1 topic to teach and understand.
